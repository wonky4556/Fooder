Make a food ordering app. It should contain a management portal and a customer facing website.
The management portal should
    - Allow provider to create menu items
    - set prices and quantities
    - schedule an ordering window when items will be available for sale
    - add food pick up instructions
    - provide a list of orders to fullfill
    - mark off orders that have been fullfilled

The customer facing site should
    - Allow users to see items for sale
    - add items to cart and submit the order
    - only allow ordering items when they are in the scheduling window
    - only allow ordering if item quantity is available

Tech stack will be
    - AWS hosted
    - React frontend
    - Common SSO authentication providers like Google

Build with ability for facing future enhancements that could include
    - Payments
    - Multi tenancy
    - Automatic notifications through Whatsapp, text messaging or email
    - Order confirmation emails

Ask me to clarify the product requirements, technical requirements, engineering principles, and hard constraints.
